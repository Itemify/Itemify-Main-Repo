# Itemify
Itemify is a project for building an Open Source 3D model market place.  
We would love if you would help working on Itemify by creating issues for bugs or features or even coding on it yourself.  

In the Repo you will see a docker compose and some git submodules. If you clone it with --recursive you can get Itemify up and running with docker compose.
